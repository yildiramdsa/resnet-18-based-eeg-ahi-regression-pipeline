An end-to-end deep learning pipeline for continuous AHI regression from EEG spectrograms using ResNet-18 architecture. The model performs automated sleep apnea severity estimation with subject-stratified validation, achieving moderate performance (RMSE: 6.8 events/hour, r = 0.76) while providing clinically relevant severity rankings across the full AHI spectrum. Features comprehensive data preprocessing, transfer learning optimization, and scalable inference for real-time sleep apnea screening applications.
